**Release Date:** January 16, 2026
**Engine:** Godot 4.x

🚀 Initial Release
We are excited to introduce Serenity, a generative art tool designed for creating intricate patterns. This initial version focuses on providing a fluid workflow for drawing, editing, and layering complex geometric designs.

✨ Key Features
**Three Distinct Pattern Modes**

* **Paradox Mode:** Generates twisted, spiral-like patterns using recursive geometry. Perfect for creating depth and motion within a shape.
* **Aura Mode:** Automatically generates "echoing" lines around your primary shape. Includes smart geometry handling to prevent overlapping loops.
* **Cellular Aura Mode:** Generates organic, interconnected "cells" or bubbles with echoing internal lines.

Live Editing & Parameters

Real-time Adjustments: Tweak your pattern parameters on the fly before "freezing" the shape.

Adjustable Variables:

Line Spacing & Count: Control the density of the pattern.

Wobble & Twist: Add organic irregularity or rotational effects.

Style: Customize Line Color and Line Width dynamically.

Drawing Tools

Bezier Curve Tool: Draw smooth, custom shapes with precision.

Point Manipulation: Easily add, drag, and reshape control points to perfect your boundary before generating the pattern inside.

Smart Layering

Clipping/Masking: New shapes are automatically clipped against previously "frozen" shapes. This allows you to stack designs without messy overlaps, preserving the integrity of earlier layers.
